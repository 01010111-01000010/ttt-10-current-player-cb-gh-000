# Tic Tac Toe Turn Count

## Outline

1. Overview. Why a turn count method? Will help with a draw and we can use it to know what player's move it is. It's also just nice to have methods that analyze your programs state.

2.  Objectives. Use iteration to start a loop. Use a yielded value. Control return values in methods that use iteration.

3. Instructions.

Turn Count requirements.

Loop through the board.
If the token in the board is X or O, it's taken, it's been a turn.
Keep track
return that total turns.

Don't use while or loop. tests will fail (we must mock this - ping avi for how).

suggest other iterators possibly.
