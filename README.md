# Tic Tac Toe Current Player

implements both turn count and current player in one lab.

## Outline

1. Overview. 

Player based on turn

Why a turn count method? Will help with a draw and we can use it to know what player's move it is. It's also just nice to have methods that analyze your programs state.

current player uses turn count.

2.  Objectives. Use iteration to start a loop. Use a yielded value. Control return values in methods that use iteration. use a method that retuns a value based on iteration. Use modulo.

3. Instructions.

Turn Count requirements.

Loop through the board.
If the token in the board is X or O, it's taken, it's been a turn.
Keep track
return that total turns.

Don't use while or loop. tests will fail (we must mock this - ping avi for how).

suggest other iterators possibly.

current_player

How modulo works.

return X or O based on even or odd

other idesas for odd / even?
